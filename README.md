Getting and Cleaning Data Project
==============
This is the GitHub Repository for the 
[Getting and Cleaning Data](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-007) Course Project.
## Project Description ##
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a 
data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.  
In more details, the following steps are required to complete the assignment:
    1) a tidy data set as described below;
    2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis; 
    3) a Code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations performed 
    to clean up the data called.
### Data Description:
The data considered for the Project represent data collected from the 
accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
A full description is available at the web site where the data was obtained:
[http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones]().
The whole data package can be downloaded at the following link:

## Data Analysis ##

To perform the data analysis it is required to perform the following **4 steps**:
To perform the data analysis it is required to perform the following **steps**:

* **Clone** this repository into a folder on the local machine:
    `git clone https://github.com/leriomaggio/getting-and-cleaning-data.git` 

*  **Set the Working Directory** to the folder where the Git repository has been cloned:

        setwd("<CLONE REPO FOLDER PATH>")

*  **Download and Unzip** the data package by clicking at the following url:
    [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip]()
    or by running the following commands into the **R Terminal Console**:
    or by sourcing the `downloadata.R` w/ the command:

        source("./downloadata.R")
        download.data()

    This R script will download the data package, and it will store the 
    downloaded package into a `dataset.zip` file located into the `datasets`
    folder.

* **Source** the `run_analysis.R` script:
* **Source** the `run_analysis.R` script: 

        setwd("<CLONE REPO FOLDER PATH>")
        source("run_analysis.R")

  Sourcing the `run_analysis.R` script will perform the actual analysis. In particular:
     - Read the Dataset
     - Merges the training and the test sets to create one single data set.
     - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
     - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
     - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
     - Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable 
         for each activity and each subject.
  After performing the analysis, the following files will be created:
    - `merged_and_cleaned_dataset.txt` (*corresponding to a `10299x68` data frame*)
    - `tidy_dataset_with_average_values.txt` (*corresponding to a `180x68` data frame*)
    
* **Use data**: to read and use the data it is necessary to run the following command:
        data <- read.table("tidy_dataset_with_average_values.txt")
  It will correspond to a `180x68` data frame w/ 30 subjects and 6 activities
  (i.e., 30 x 6 = 180 rows)
## Final Notes:
The provided R script makes assumptions on the location of files to process (dataset).
However, no assumptions is made on the numbers of rows and columns of the data frame
to process during the analysis steps.
